After having left the C64 some years ago I recently came back to see if this old project would still compile and decided to put this here on codeberg.


# Zoo Mania

After having left the C64 some years ago I recently came back to see
if this old project would still compile and decided to put this here
on github.


## What is it?

Zoo Mania is a puzzle game for the Commodore C64 which has been
initiated around 2005 in [Forum-64](http://www.forum-64.de) by some
folks and has been implemented in collaboration. I had the pleasure to
do the coding and finally I managed to get the sources back together
and here they are.


## Compile

Zoo Mania is a C/ASM hybrid and can be build with the
[CC65](http://cc65.github.io) compiler suite. There is a very
rudimentary Makefile, so you can just type `make` to build the game.
